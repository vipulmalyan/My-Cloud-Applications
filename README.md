[Cloud Application](https://heart-stroke-pred.streamlit.app/)

Description: In the healthcare sector, dealing with vast amounts of data requires techniques to manage it effectively. Strokes, a major cause of global mortality similar to heart attacks, demand swift medical intervention. Addressing this, an Effective Heart Stroke Prediction System (EHSPS) is being developed using machine learning. By utilizing datasets featuring 12 parameters like hypertension, heart disease, and BMI, a predictive model for strokes is being created. This model aims to swiftly identify individuals at risk of experiencing a Stroke.
